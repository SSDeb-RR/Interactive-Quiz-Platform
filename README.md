# üéØ Interactive Data Science Quiz Platform

An **AI-powered interactive quiz platform** for Data Science enthusiasts that dynamically generates quizzes based on your **chosen topic** and **skill level**. Built using a pre-tagged **JSON dataset**, fine-tuned LLMs (DeepSeek-v1 7B via Ollama), and an intuitive **Streamlit** front-end. Includes **personalized feedback generation** using LLM reasoning for every quiz session.

## üß† Project Overview

This tool is designed for learners who want to assess and improve their knowledge in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Python**, and other Data Science domains. It uses a large dataset of hand-curated questions, automatically tagged using an LLM with metadata like **topic** and **difficulty level**.

Users select their desired topic and proficiency level, and the system generates a personalized quiz. After completion, the LLM reviews incorrect answers and generates tailored feedback to help the user improve ‚Äî making it a **smart learning companion**, not just a quiz app.

## üß± Technical Architecture

### Stage 1: Metadata Tagging
- **Input**: Raw dataset of Data Science questions (stored in JSON).
- **Output**: Each question is annotated with:
  - Topic (e.g., Python, ML, DL, etc.)
  - Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)

> Questions were tagged using an LLM to enable topic-wise and difficulty-wise selection.

### Stage 2: Quiz Generation + Feedback Loop
- **User selects**:
  - Proficiency level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
  - Topic(s) of interest
- **Quiz Generator**:
  - Pulls matching questions from the local JSON dataset.
  - Presents questions one-by-one on the Streamlit interface.
- **Feedback Engine**:
  - After submission, incorrect answers are passed through the LLM.
  - Generates **personalized feedback** explaining:
    - Where the learner went wrong.
    - Suggestions for improvement or revision.
